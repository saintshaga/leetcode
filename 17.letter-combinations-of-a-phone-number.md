Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.



A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.



Input:Digit string "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].



Note:
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.


思路也是没有问题

代码最主要的问题是在边界的返回结果，就是遍历到n的时候，应该返回空串，以方便n-1的+操作，但是刚开始写的时候，写成了直接返回空串
