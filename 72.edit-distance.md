Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)



You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:



a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

DP的题目，最难的是最优子结构，这题的最优子结构没有找到，参考了下答案：

We define the state dp[i][j] to be the minimum number of operations to convert word1[0..i - 1] to word2[0..j - 1]

1. dp[i][0] = i;
2. dp[0][j] = j;
3. dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1], if word1[i - 1] = word2[j - 1];
4. dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1), otherwise.
